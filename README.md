## Summary  
There is definitely a positivity bias towards paid reviews however the sample size of the paid reviews is very small compared to the unpaid reviews so I would caution against using this a definitive analysis another metric to look at is the avg star rating on the paid vs unpaid which also has a pretty wide gap
